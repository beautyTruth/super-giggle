# It's not hard: don't treason (betray)

Betray is an infinitive synonym for treason. Webster's needs to change that soon. But the sentiment is the same: don't commit treason and don't start a coup. Find another occupation if you're doing either of those two things as part of your job. This composition deals with that apparent dilemma happening with activism in my country right now. I mean, it's kind of cool to not go to prison for ten or more years for treason, isn't it?

Please use these source files freely. And don't betray.
